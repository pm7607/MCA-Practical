<!-- Create a PHP script that performs the following tasks using the associative array of student names and their scores: $students = [
"Alice" => 85, "Bob" => 78, "Charlie" => 92, "David" => 67, "Eve" => 90
];
- Display the total number of students in the array.
- Print all student names separately.
- Print all scores separately.
- Calculate and display the sum and product of all student scores.
- Find and display the lowest and highest scores in the array.
- Check if any student has scored exactly 90, and display the result. - Find and display the name of the student who scored 92.
- Sort and display the students by their scores in ascending order.
- Sort and display the students by their scores in descending order.
- Sort and display the students by their names in alphabetical order (A-Z).
- Sort and display the students by their names in reverse alphabetical order (Z-A). - Merge the $students array with another associative array of students: $newStudents = [
"Frank" => 75,
"Grace" => 88 ];
- Display the merged result using both array_merge() and array_merge_recursive() and explain the difference. - Extract and display the Ùè∞Ärst 3 students from the original $students array using array_slice().  -->
